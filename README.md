Iteration 1:
Screens:
Welcome Screen -> 
Explore Screen -> Must do questionnaire -> Must do list
Profile Screen -> Log in/Sign up -> Reset Email/Password -> Log Out

We implemented a welcome screen which shows our App name and slogan, automatically swithced to Explore Screen. 
In Explore Screen, we have a map with a couple entries (topics) for users to browse. In the right corner, we built a questionnaire and generate 
customized must-do-list for users. In profile screen, users can log in, sign up or reset email/password. Users can also have access to the must-do-list in both Explore Screen and Profile Screen.

Our 3 data collections:
1. users:
This includes username, email, userId and userSelections (it refers to the user's answer for the questionnaire)
2. bookmarks:
This is the user's saved detailed pages such as how to get a SIN. It includes userId and according bookmarks.
3. details:
This is the details of all contents that displayed in the different topics.
